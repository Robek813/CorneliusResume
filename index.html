        surrounding isles</em></p>
      <p>The following paragraph will serve as a descriptive biography of
        Lord Baron Cornelius Cornwellingtonsworth IV. From a young age Lord
      Cornelius was an impish and fickle cuss that only liked to eat caviar and
    buttercream-frosted Turkish Delights. His demeanor and temperment were so
    insufferable that when he was just 5 years old his own mother decided that he
    should undergo education early and sent for the most accomplished Dog trainer
    in all of Cornwellingtonshire. After Lord Cornelius' thorough canine
    behavioral conditioning was complete, he became much more agreeable and
    obedient to his parents. However, he was caught red-handed conducting himself
    very unlike the stately position that his famliy name would suggest. He was
    found drinking from toliet bowls, chewing on scraps of food from the garbage and
    licking himself clean instead of taking a bath. Later, after having the easiest
    life of any human or dog, Lord Cornelius excepted his Baron title and became
    the most mediocre ruler Cornwellingtonshire had ever endured, and to this day
    is celebrated each year on <em>Cornwellingtonsworth's day</em> as the most
    average and uninspiring Baron ever to bless the British isles.</p>
